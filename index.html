                <h1>1. TEAM PROFILE !</h1>
                <p>We wanted to create a name that would reflect our team members' goals to begin careers 
                    in the information technology field and take part in exciting initiatives in the future, 
                    so we came up with "Hi-Tech Squad." We could be motivated by the name of this group to develop a cutting-edge program or piece of media 
                    that one day will be useful to all users. 
                </p>
                <h3>1.1 Pandega Bimata Abhinaya </h3>
                <p>My name is Pandega Bimata Abhinaya, most people just call me Abhi or AB. 
                    I'm 19 years old and this is my first year at RMIT University Vietnam. My student ID is S3963166, and my student email is S3963166@rmit.edu.vn. 
                    I am majoring in information technology (IT) and minoring in artificial intelligence at RMIT University. 
                    I received my high school diploma with an IB Diploma from the Australian International School, one of the international institutions in Vietnam. 
                    When I moved to Vietnam in my senior year of high school, information technology ignited me. 
                    It is brought on by my personal interest in how artificial intelligence functions in modern technology like phones, computers, stands, and other devices.
                    Since the digitalization era has begun, the world will mostly be ruled by technology where humans will not be able to live with it. 
                    This does enhance my interest about how AI understands precisely how does the user wants and also I want to research something that is occurring now and 
                    in the future. I don't currently have adequate IT experience as a freshman. 
                    Even though I took IT courses in high school, I still only feel as though I have a rudimentary understanding of the topic. But as time goes on, I'll make an effort
                     to learn something new that could improve my IT knowledge and help me become a better IT professional 
                     in order to make sure that my interest has been appropriately and precisely addressed.

                <p>Hello My name is Grigory Kovtun but people usually call me Greg and my Student ID is S3927476.

                <h3>1.3 Tran Pham Quoc Vy</h3>
                <p>My name is Tran Pham Quoc Vy, I'm 19 years old, my student ID is s4011912 and my student gmail is s4011912@rmit.edu.vn Although this is my first 
                    year in RMIT University Saigon South Campus Viet Nam but I used to study at Monash University Clayton and I transferred back. I took Bachelor of Computer Science
                    in Data Science in Monash University and Bachelor of Information and Technology with a minor of Data Analytics in RMIT University.
                    I also completed my Diploma of Information and Technology in Monash College. I started having interested in studying about IT and CS when I 
                    was in grade 11 and that always lives inside me. I love data and that's why my minor in both universities are linked to it. Personally, I 
                    think data has an important role in nowadays world. Without data, we won't be able to visualize things that can't be read just by looking 
                    at numbers or texts. Back in Monash University, I have gathered lots of experience and knowledge that allow me to do stuff such as coding, 
                    creating interfaces, presenting or even designing a whole database system. I'm an expert in Python, C++, Java, R and I also know how to do some
                    assembly languages such as MIPS and MARIE. But I don't think that's enough for me, that's why I trust RMIT University to give me more experience and knowledge
                    so that I can be so much more completed, more than who I am right now.

<!-----PROJECT DESC ----->
                <h1>3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
                <h3>3.1. Topic</h3>
                <p> We are now working on a project regarding mindfulness meditation for this topic. 
                    We developed this initiative in order to help those who desire to relax and feel more at ease with their emotions. 
                    The goal of our group's initiative is to educate individuals how to meditate in order to control their emotions while also offering support and advise.
                     This project is primarily intended for teens whose emotions will be unstable owing to their lifestyles, for example, heavy school loads, 
                     intense parental pressure, personal problems, and many other reasons that might alter their attitude and emotions. Not only for teenagers, 
                     also it could help the adult to feel more relaxed and calmer with their emotion too.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     In a discussion, our group shared its opinions regarding the project's components and potential features that may be introduced to help users 
                     get the most out of what they require. As a result, we included a variety of items, such as music, films, meditation techniques, and more. 
                     The outcome expectation for us is fairly high because we positioned the features in a way that fits their needs and wants. We also added some 
                     soothing music and movies. This is one way to support the user's meditation. In order to change the user's emotions and attitude from one of negative to 
                     positive, our objective is to satisfy the consumer with the features we've provided.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2. Motivation</h3>
                <p>Our shared aim for working on this project is to assist people and app users in finding emotional and life balance. 
                    It is a highly vital project to be developed since suicide rates continue to rise yearly and because everyone's mental health is 
                    crucial to their ability to be healthy and productive. Since we're attempting to create this project utilizing coding and AI assistance, 
                    it does belong in the IT disciplines. This project will demonstrate to a potential employer that we are able to write some code to add our additions to the project.
                    In addition, as we gain more experience writing those features, our understanding of coding may advance, which will be extremely helpful in the future. 
                </p>

                <h3>3.3. Landscape</h3>
                 <P>   
                    There are some project that are looks like our project which has been developed first but we are trying to make the better version
                    compare to the other project competitors. As an instance a project called Calm is one of the meditation app that already discovered before. 
                    This software was created with certain features, such as some questions on what type of meditation the users require and instructions on how to meditate. 
                    The fact that we also provide some questions, yet handle users differently, is what distinguishes our app from others. Because we will provide a variety of 
                    techniques using the qualities we possess, and they will be made available to the user for meditation's best outcomes.
                </p>

                <h3>4.5. Tools And Technologies</h3>
                <p> To create the meditation application, we have decided to split the process of developing it into three separate parts. One is for Android development, 
                    the other is for IOS development, and one for the website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the field of Android development, we have decided to use Java as our main programming language. Java is one if not the best language for 
                    developing applications or mobile version of the technology for Android. The version of Java that is going to be used is Java SE Development 
                    Kit 20.0.1(JDK 20.0.1) which is the latest version of the programming language. After we have chosen Java, IDEs are quite easy choices. 
                    For desktop version, IntelliJ is an IDE developed by JetBrains which is mainly used to code Java. We are going to use the latest ultimate 
                    version of IntelliJ which is 2023.1.2. IntelliJ is such a great integrated development environment because it has lots of features and tools that 
                    help us developers to save our time. IntelliJ’s debug feature is one of the best features that any IDEs can produce. For mobile version, Android 
                    studio will be used. Android studio mainly uses Java as its’ programming language, and the IDE features also quite the same as IntelliJ. The reason 
                    that it’s suitable for the mobile version is because Android studio has an emulator feature that helps developers to have a clear look of how the 
                    code will be transferred into the user interface. We are also going to use the latest version of the IDEs which is Android Studio Flamingo version 
                    2022.2.1. The two IDEs also support developers with Android SDK which is really important and indispensable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the field of IOS development, we have decided to use Swift as our main programming language. Swift is not as popular as Java, but they are suitable 
                    for the IDEs that we are going to use to match the IOS system which is Xcode. Xcode is a powerful IDE for IOS users as it provides advanced debugging 
                    features and it also supports users with documentary and community support. The version of Swift we are going to use is Swift 5.8.1 which is the latest 
                    Swift version. For Xcode, the version of the IDE will be Xcode 14.3.1 which is also the latest version of the IDE.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In developing the website, we plan to use HTML for designing the structure and interfaces of the website. We are going to use CSS for the style of the text, 
                    page, pictures, … of the website. To be able to implement the website, after discussion, we have decided and chose VS Code as the main IDE to work with. 
                    The version of VS Code that will be used is VS Code version 1.78 which is the latest version. We are also going to use ReactJS and Node JS for the backend 
                    of the website also. The versions that we will use are React 18.2.0 and Node 11.3.244.8, these are the latest versions themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To store the data of customers as well as our content for the technology, we decided that we are not going to use SQL Server but instead use NoSQL severs which 
                    specifically we are going to use MongoDB since it such a great NoSQL that has been used by lots of technology companies in the world like eBay, MetLife, … The 
                    version of MongoDB that will be used is MongoDB 5.3 and we’re looking forward to upgrade the version to 6.0 when it’s released.
