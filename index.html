                <p>We wanted to create a name that would reflect our team members' goals to begin careers 
                    in the information technology field and take part in exciting initiatives in the future, 
                    so we came up with "Hi-Tech Squad." We could be motivated by the name of this group to develop a cutting-edge program or piece of media 
                    that one day will be useful to all users.

                <p>My name is Pandega Bimata Abhinaya, most people just call me Abhi or AB. 
                    I'm 19 years old and this is my first year at RMIT University Vietnam. My student ID is S3963166, and my student email is S3963166@rmit.edu.vn. 
                    I am majoring in information technology (IT) and minoring in artificial intelligence at RMIT University. 
                    I received my high school diploma with an IB Diploma from the Australian International School, one of the international institutions in Vietnam. 
                    When I moved to Vietnam in my senior year of high school, information technology ignited me. 
                    It is brought on by my personal interest in how artificial intelligence functions in modern technology like phones, computers, stands, and other devices.
                    Since the digitalization era has begun, the world will mostly be ruled by technology where humans will not be able to live with it. 
                    This does enhance my interest about how AI understands precisely how does the user wants and also I want to research something that is occurring now and 
                    in the future. I don't currently have adequate IT experience as a freshman. 
                    Even though I took IT courses in high school, I still only feel as though I have a rudimentary understanding of the topic. But as time goes on, I'll make an effort
                     to learn something new that could improve my IT knowledge and help me become a better IT professional 
                     in order to make sure that my interest has been appropriately and precisely addressed.

                <p>My name is Grigory Kovtun and my Student ID is s3927476 and my student email is s3927476@rmit.edu.vn. My major is in Web and Applications development however I also want to take a minor in Artificial Intelligence in the future, because I am very interested in that field. 
                    Although this is my second education and my initial education is in economics, I have always been fascinated by the world of IT and computer science, 
                    that is why I am very happy to be studying in RMIT - the best university in Vietnam. 
I am very eager to continue my education and very happy with the subjects given to students. Even though I have experience working as a business analyst, 
                    I feel the need to constantly improve and upgrade my skills in order to keep up with the instruction at university. 
                    However, I am confident it will become easier in the future as I and my friends gain knowledge of the core subjects. 
                    As a freshman, I am doing my best to make the most out of the opportunity and become job-ready by the end of the three years in Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.

                    year in RMIT University Saigon South Campus Viet Nam but I used to study at Monash University Clayton and I transferred back. I took Bachelor of Computer Science
                    in Data Science in Monash University and Bachelor of Information and Technology with a minor of Data Analytics in RMIT University.
                    I also completed my Diploma of Information and Technology in Monash College. I started having interested in studying about IT and CS when I 
                    was in grade 11 and that always lives inside me. I love data and that's why my minor in both universities are linked to it. Personally, I 
                    think data has an important role in nowadays world. Without data, we won't be able to visualize things that can't be read just by looking 
                    at numbers or texts. Back in Monash University, I have gathered lots of experience and knowledge that allow me to do stuff such as coding, 
                    creating interfaces, presenting or even designing a whole database system. I'm an expert in Python, C++, Java, R and I also know how to do some
                    assembly languages such as MIPS and MARIE. But I don't think that's enough for me, that's why I trust RMIT University to give me more experience and knowledge
                    so that I can be so much more completed, more than who I am right now.

                <h3 id="3.1. Topic">3.1. Topic</h3>
                <p> We are now working on a project regarding mindfulness meditation for this topic. 
                    We developed this initiative in order to help those who desire to relax and feel more at ease with their emotions. 
                    The goal of our group's initiative is to educate individuals how to meditate in order to control their emotions while also offering support and advise.
                     This project is primarily intended for teens whose emotions will be unstable owing to their lifestyles, for example, heavy school loads, 
                     intense parental pressure, personal problems, and many other reasons that might alter their attitude and emotions. Not only for teenagers, 
                     also it could help the adult to feel more relaxed and calmer with their emotion too.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     In a discussion, our group shared its opinions regarding the project's components and potential features that may be introduced to help users 
                     get the most out of what they require. As a result, we included a variety of items, such as music, films, meditation techniques, and more. 
                     The outcome expectation for us is fairly high because we positioned the features in a way that fits their needs and wants. We also added some 
                     soothing music and movies. This is one way to support the user's meditation. In order to change the user's emotions and attitude from one of negative to 
                     positive, our objective is to satisfy the consumer with the features we've provided.
                </p>

                <h3 id="3.2. Motivation">3.2. Motivation</h3>
                <p>Our shared aim for working on this project is to assist people and app users in finding emotional and life balance. 
                    It is a highly vital project to be developed since suicide rates continue to rise yearly and because everyone's mental health is 
                    crucial to their ability to be healthy and productive. Since we're attempting to create this project utilizing coding and AI assistance, 
                    it does belong in the IT disciplines. This project will demonstrate to a potential employer that we are able to write some code to add our additions to the project.
                    In addition, as we gain more experience writing those features, our understanding of coding may advance, which will be extremely helpful in the future.

                <h3 id="3.3. Landscape">3.3. Landscape</h3>
                 <P>   
                    There are some project that are looks like our project which has been developed first but we are trying to make the better version
                    compare to the other project competitors. As an instance a project called Calm is one of the meditation app that already discovered before. 
                    This software was created with certain features, such as some questions on what type of meditation the users require and instructions on how to meditate. 
                    The fact that we also provide some questions, yet handle users differently, is what distinguishes our app from others. Because we will provide a variety of 
                    techniques using the qualities we possess, and they will be made available to the user for meditation's best outcomes.

<!-----DETAILED AIMED-->
                <h1 id="4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION">4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
                <h3 id="4.1. Aims">4.1. Aims</h3>
                <p>
                    The main aim of this project is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) of a user-friendly and a feature-rich meditation app for web and mobile platforms that will encompass the best 
                    developed practices when it comes to meditation application development, as well as make an attempt at developing some experimental features such as voice-control and machine learning 
                    algorithms to enhance the user's meditation experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to achieve this overarching aim, we need to achieve 4 specific intermediate technical goals:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>User experience and interface design as well as basic functionality;</p></li>
                        <li><p>Content development;</p></li>
                        <li><p>Personalization and progress system development;</p></li>
                        <li><p>Community and social integration;</p></li>

                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as UI design goes, this is the stage that is currently in process. It is crucial for the first part of developing the Minimum viable product (MVP) in order to have a concise 
                    prototype of our application.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The content development goal will also play a huge role as the content itself is very important for user retention and attraction. The richness of content and our ability to match it with 
                    the user's needs will play a pivotal role in the success of the app.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The personalization and progress system development goal is closely tied to the first goal but essentially we plan to focus on its development throughout the project. It is a vast area of 
                    work that can have a lot of inputs in the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Development of community and social integration aspects is a goal that will come into full effect once we verify that our MVP is working and that the app can and will work effectively. Once 
                    that is done, we can focus on making the most out of social and community power.


                </p>

                <h3 id="4.2. Plans And Progress">4.2. Plans And Progress</h3>
                <p>
                <p>As mentioned above, the main purpose of this project and its overarching scope is a MVP of a meditation app that, given an initial success, will leverage the modern technologies in the AI/ML and wearable device domain to deliver the best possible meditation experience to users. 
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Short story of the project</b>
            </p>
                    <br>
            <p>
                    When our team was tasked with the current project, we had a lot of options on our hands. If you think about it, it is the year 2023 and a lot of applications that would once meet the innovation requirements are now obsolete and have been created a long time ago.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming a lot of ideas from different areas and walks of life - finance, sociology, economics as well as social media and audio/visual domains. A lot of good ideas were proposed and disregarded but we all agreed on one specific point: we wanted our project to have purpose and also we wanted our project to bring real value to people and not just be a for-profit business venture. 
That is why we finally decided to brainstorm in the medicine-wellbeing field and gradually started leaning towards the meditation domain.
The reasons for us finally choosing meditation as the main topic for our project and application are quite simple:
            </p>
                       
                        <ol>
                        <li><p>Meditation is on of the things that really helps people and creates feasible benefits in everyday life;;</p></li>
                        <li><p>Unlike the medical sphere, meditation does not require us personally to have a deep understanding knowledge of the subject and allows us to garner the knowledge from open sources as well rely on the professional community without fearing being in the wrong, because at the end of the day it is all about the inner peace that people get from sessions and not some medical miracles.;</p></li>                      
                    </ol>
                    
            <p>
            Once we finally settled on the option, we felt immediate relief because the vast scope of endless possibilities of options was sometimes too much to handle.
We then proceeded to research on the topic, and study the current market of meditation applications.
We then proceeded to think through the technical aspects of our project which I will cover in the following parts of this document.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>What has been done and work currently in progress</b>
            </p>
            <p> If we were to outline the parts of the project that we have already done, then we would provide the following three main points:
            </p>
            <p>
                 <ol>
                        <li><p>Objective definition and plan outline;;</p></li>

            </p>
        
        <p>Although building an MVP implies a pretty quick and iterative approach to development where the team's main goal is to test out ideas as quickly as possible and assess the users' reaction, we have decided to focus on thinking through most of the things relevant to our application design, market positioning and feature choice.
        </p>
        <p>The reason for such an approach is pretty simple and straightforward: we understand that the more things we actually take into a account before we build the application, the better it will be in the long run and the more possible mistakes we will be able to avoid in the future and save a lot of precious time and resources because we won't need to overhaul the whole application because of a flaw in logic, design or the database.
        </p>
        <p>So after having decided on the objectives, scope and main definitions of our project, we proceeded to perform research in all shapes and forms - user research, competitor research, market research.
        </p>
        <p>All the three above mentioned components gave us a pretty clear understanding of our target audience and the current state of the market, as well as the features and perks provided by projects that are already active in the space of meditation applications.<br>
We took into account our findings when we we creating our current and future planning activities, as well as objective formulation.<br>
So it will be possible to say that the objective definition phase and the research phase were happening side by side and in an iterative manner, where we would modify our draft plans if we found some compelling evidence during our research.
        </p>
        <p>Once we figured out the first two points, we proceeded to the crucial MVP part - web prototype creation. We didn't expect nor want anything too fancy, so we got to work. In the "technologies'' part of this report we have covered in detail the technologies we used while creating the web prototype.<br>
Because of the time constraints, we understood that we wouldn't be able to create a 100% working prototype, so we decided to focus on the main parts - the main page, color theme, basic content on the main page. The prototype does not yet have the backend meditation session mechanics, but we are working on it.
        </p>
        <p>We thought of it as the first brick in the building we would call our application in the future.<br>
We needed this start to get the project up and running and to make sure we started out work and not solely focused on planning and outlining our thought process on paper. <br>
So in essence, the web prototype is a work in progress and future work will be based on this prototype.
        </p>
        <p><b>Plans</b>
        </p>
        <p>We plan to build upon our current work in future iterations of our project.<br>
Our current main objective is to build a fully functioning web application. In other words, we should complete our MVP and make it a working standalone application. 

        </p>
        <p>This will require us developing the following functionalities:
        </p>
        <p> <ol>
                        <li><p>Basic functionality implementation: user personal account, meditation sessions;</p></li>
                        <li><p>Content addition to the application;</p></li>     
        <li><p>Progress tracking and analytics functionality implementation;</p></li>
        <li><p>Community and social integration implementation;
;</p></li>
                    </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once the MVP proves its worth and will demonstrate an ability to sustain itself, we will focus on the advanced features that will hopefully make our application stand out from the rest.

        </p>
        <p>We can outline the following main pillars of our future work:

        </p>
        <p><ol>
                        <li><p>Wearable device and health apps integration;</p></li>
                        <li><p>ML algorithms application to the application data;</p></li>    
                    </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The order of the abovementioned functionalities is not random: it builds one on top of the other and allows for gradual increase in complexity of our application. We understand that we have to abide by our main goals and the scope. <br>
As can be seen from the list above, our future work is highly correlated with the main aim and goals we outlined previously. <br>
We plan to take an iterative approach to development and pay a lot of attention to testing to avoid problems that will set us up for failure in the future. 

        </p>
        <p>Because we are a 4-person team, we will also try to adopt an agile approach in our work to ensure flexibility and make sure we can promptly react to changes in ideas and feature implementation. 
        </p>
        <p>As we lack experience, we hope that this project will allow us to grasp the essentials of working in the IT industry and will provide us with a lot of valuable lessons along the way. And in essence, we are very confident that teamwork and consistency will yield excellent results that will show in the way users react to the application.
        </p>

                <h3 id="4.3. Roles">4.3. Roles</h3>
                <p> To complete this project, we need to give everyone a role so that the project can go well. There are 4 main roles to talk about. First, the project manager, the person who has the role 
                    will be responsible for the direction of the project. It means that they need to make sure the project is going on the right path. Also the project manager is also the one who is going 
                    to find and research about the topic that we are doing. Besides, they need to ensure the whole team's communication is good. Next is the UI/UX designer, the person who has the role will 
                    take charge for designing the user interface of the website and the application of the project, they will also need to design the user experience. This is quite an important role because 
                    this can decide whether our project is going to be successful or not. Moving forward to the next role which is front-end developer, the member that holds the role will be responsible for 
                    developing the interactive parts of the website and the application, they will need lots of knowledge since our project is expected to appear on different platforms which will be developed 
                    in different coding languages. The final role that we can talk about is the back-end developer, this role is responsible for developing and working on the components that work behind the 
                    scenes. They are also in charge of the database section and the security part of the website and the application. The front-end and back-end developer will need to communicate and work 
                    together continuously in the developing phase to produce the technologies. After defining the roles, we think our team can be divided as Greg will take the project manager role since he 
                    does research a lot, Dustin(Dai Thanh) will be the UI/UX designer because his ability to design stuff is excellent, AB will be the front-end developer since his knowledge about HTML, CSS, 
                    Javascript and others is extremely strong and Vy will be the back-end developer because he has strong based knowledge about data science and data analytics as well as coding.


                </p>

                <h3 id="4.4. Scopes and Limits">4.4. Scopes and Limits</h3>
                <p>
                    Because we are currently in the initial stage of the project and need to create an MVP - the minimum viable product, it is essential that we clearly define the scope and limits of our application 
                    in order to avoid "scope creep".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The current scope needed for the success of the project will be limited by the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Basic meditation functionality: meditation routes and tracks for users, basic session options, as well as a brief selection of guided meditation options.</p></li>
                        <li><p>User profile and registration functionality: we won't heavily focus on integration with other platforms, instead we will opt for the basic registration options and maybe some authorization 
                            through external apps.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Progress tracking and gamification: we plan to implement a basic tracking system that will interactively show data about meditation sessions, duration, etc.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Content: we plan to create a couple of guided tracks and sessions for users in order to test the response and iterate on the results</p></li>
                        <li><p>Limited ML and AI usage: because we need user data to work with and improve upon, our MVP will possess limited AI capabilities that will come into effect in the future.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any additional advanced features such as content enrichment, wearable devices and health apps integration, advanced gamification and monetization - will be focused on once the MVP will prove 
                    its worth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The scope outlined above will allow our team to focus on the key features and determine the viability of our MVP first and not waste time on unnecessary additional features that will not bring 
                    any immediate value. This approach allows development to happen in stages and iterations that will help our team and the project on the whole to align with user preferences and needs in the future.
                </p>

                <h3 id="4.5. Tools And Technologies">4.5. Tools And Technologies</h3>
                <p> To create the meditation application, we have decided to split the process of developing it into three separate parts. One is for Android development, the other is for IOS development, 
                    and one is for the website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the field of Android development, we have decided to use Java as our main programming language. Java is one if not the best language for developing applications or mobile versions 
                    of the technology for Android. The version of Java that is going to be used is Java SE Development Kit 20.0.1(JDK 20.0.1) which is the latest version of the programming language. 
                    After we have chosen Java, IDEs are quite easy choices. For the desktop version, IntelliJ is an IDE developed by JetBrains which is mainly used to code Java. We are going to use the 
                    latest ultimate version of IntelliJ which is 2023.1.2. IntelliJ is such a great integrated development environment because it has lots of features and tools that help us developers 
                    save time. IntelliJâ€™s debug feature is one of the best features that any IDEs can produce. For the mobile version, Android Studio will be used. Android Studio mainly uses Java as its 
                    programming language, and the IDE features are also quite the same as IntelliJ. The reason that itâ€™s suitable for the mobile version is that Android Studio has an emulator feature 
                    that helps developers to have a clear look at how the code will be transferred into the user interface. We are also going to use the latest version of the IDEs which is Android Studio 
                    Flamingo version 2022.2.1. The two IDEs also support developers with Android SDK which is important and indispensable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the field of IOS development, we have decided to use Swift as our main programming language. Swift is not as popular as Java, but they are suitable for the IDEs that we are going 
                    to use to match the IOS system which is Xcode. Xcode is a powerful IDE for IOS users as it provides advanced debugging features and it also supports users with documentary and community 
                    support. The version of Swift we are going to use is Swift 5.8.1 which is the latest Swift version. For Xcode, the version of the IDE will be Xcode 14.3.1 which is also the latest version 
                    of the IDE.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In developing the website, we plan to use HTML for designing the structure and interfaces of the website. We are going to use CSS for the style of the text, page, pictures, â€¦ of the 
                    website. To be able to implement the website, after discussion, we have decided and chosen VS Code as the main IDE to work with. The version of VS Code that will be used is VS Code version 
                    1.78 which is the latest version. We are also going to use ReactJS and Node JS for the backend of the website also. The versions that we will use are React 18.2.0 and Node 11.3.244.8, these 
                    are the latest versions themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To store the data of customers as well as our content for the technology, we decided that we are not going to use SQL Server but instead use NoSQL servers which specifically we are going to 
                    use MongoDB since it is such a great NoSQL that has been used by lots of technology companies in the world like eBay, MetLife, â€¦ The version of MongoDB that will be used is MongoDB 5.3 and 
                    weâ€™re looking forward to upgrading the version to 6.0 when itâ€™s released.
                </p>

                <h3 id="4.6. Testing">4.6. Testing</h3>
                <p> Pre Developing:
                    To test the usability of the application and the website, these are the steps that we will use. First, we create one prototype of the website and one prototype 
                    for the application: The prototypes don't need to be fully functional; itâ€™s only needed to tell testers the full concept of the application and website. Record 
                    the user's occupation before testing. Then, we will create a list of tasks and ask the user to use the prototypes to complete those tasks. While the testers are 
                    doing the given tasks, we will record their behavior and ask them to describe the process. After they have finished their tasks, we will ask them 10 questions and 
                    their answers are going to be based on SUS. After recording the data and everything, we will calculate the final SUS score and make judgments about our prototypes 
                    to see whether itâ€™s good enough to start developing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Developing:
                    While developing the website and application, we will have testers that will try and find bugs that make the program crash. Testing will be conducted continuously 
                    during this phase since we do not want any bugs when we finish the program and get to the post-development stage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Post development:
                    When we have finished developing the website and the application, this is the time to decorate our technologies. But to decorate that will fit and please the users 
                    of this technology, we will design lots of pictures, add music, ... and then we will gather a group of meditators and let them choose their favorite themes, then we 
                    collect the data and the most chosen one which is the one that fit and please the meditators will be used for our website and application.



                </p>

                <h3 id="4.7. Timeframe">4.7. Timeframe</h3>
                <p> After we have decided on everything that is needed for the project, itâ€™s time to set a timeframe. The project is expected to be done in at least 1 year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the first 2 months, we will develop our prototypes for the website and the application as well as test to see if the prototypes are good enough. 
                    For the first week, we will work on our website prototype, drawing, using tools such as Figma and Balsamiq. Lots of prototypes will be produced so 
                    we can test more and understand what users need in the field of meditation. For the second week, we will start to make lists of tasks and SUS questions 
                    to ask users while they are testing our prototypes. In the third week, we will start looking for testers and let them use our prototypes, and in the 
                    final week of the first month, we will analyze the data that we collected from testers to decide which prototype will be used in the developing phase. 
                    The other month will be the same process that we described but this time is for our application.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, the progress of developing the website and the application will take about 9 months. This is the phase we need to code and test our code every time 
                    we add a feature or a function to see whether the website and application work smoothly and have no bugs. 3 of the first 9 months will be spent developing 
                    the website. In the first month, we planned to complete the layout of the website which includes many pages. We are going to do that using HTML, CSS, and 
                    the IDE as mentioned above is VS Code. The second month will be spent to implement the features and functions of the website using ReactJS and NodeJS and 
                    the final month is to test for bugs, fix it and connect the website to the database server. The next 3 will be developing the Android application. In the 
                    first month, we will try our best to complete the layout of the website without any functions or features using Java and Android Studio. In the second month, 
                    we will add all of our features and functions into the application and the last month is to find and fix bugs as well as connect the application to the 
                    database server. The last 3 will be IOS applications, the process is quite similar except that we are going to use Swift and Xcode to match the IOS system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then in the final month, we will design and put pictures and themes into our technologies. This is just an expected plan for the timeframe, when we do the 
                    project, there will be challenges and difficulties that delay our work but we will always try to get on track with the plan that we made.
                </p>

                <h3 id="4.8. Risks">4.8. Risks</h3>
                <p> Developing the website and application of meditation can have lots of risks. We may have left out some bugs in the testing phase which 
                    lead to crashes of the website and the application before we launch the technologies. This problem is huge so to minimize or eliminate 
                    the problem, we need to create multiple test cases and be careful during the testing phase. Another problem that we can face is that 
                    our website and application use a NoSQL server to store data, so there might be a chance that if too many users access our technologies, 
                    the server may crash. Also, weâ€™ll try our best to improve our server so users can have good experiences.


                </p>

                <h3 id="4.9. Group Processes and Communications">4.9. Group Processes and Communications</h3>
                <p>In order to ensure productive teamwork and reduce the challenge of difficulties, we have developed efficient plans and anticipated levels of communication together. First, for the majority of part, we'll combine online resources with in-person sessions to encourage conversation between group members. Then, we made the decision to use a contact network like Discord for routine communication because it enables real-time communication, file sharing, and simple collaboration. To encourage active participation and quick responses from all group members, we will set up specific channels for all types of problems related to the project. On top of that, we will have meetings at University twice a week to talk about our progress, discuss any issues, and make plans for the tasks before.

On the other hand, if a group member does not react to communications, we will make several attempts to reach out to them to ensure they are informed about the get-in-touch attempts. If the problem doesn't go away, we'll escalate it to the project leader and decide together what the best choice of action is, such as making a report to a change member or asking the professor for assistance.

Overall, our group understands the value of consistent communication and the necessity of staying in touch at least once a week outside of class. To encourage an advantageous and efficient team dynamic throughout the project, we will contribute to open conversation, and try to be more confident to speak our opinion when we work together.

                <p>Through the process that we have been working on our group project, we have	produce a great and positive outcome for our plan and our group assignment. 
                    We communicated with each other nicely, we distributed our jobs equally and also we did our job perfectly as a group. As the role for me I started on the HTML code and also the GitHub repository, 
                    which we used to collaborate and made some commit changes for the HTML reports. Even though it is my first year as an RMIT student, for this type of project I have no difficulties working with this 
                    group, because our bonding and we are connected to finish this project. What could be improved for me is I need to train my leadership skills and keep in touch with the group more often and ask about
                    how they are doing with the project so we won't be hustling and wait till the end of the time. From this group I have learned that working as a team is important, because of how we could exchange 
                    our ideas and perspectives with other teammates, also it could improve our knowledge and this type of group project will be very useful in the future.

                <p>
                    
                If I were to answer the question with all sincerity, 
                    I would say that I genuinely enjoyed working on the project with the team. 
                    The reasons for this are quite straightforward: 
                    a) the team consists of hard-working individuals who are studying Information Technology for a reason 
                    and want to excel in the field; 
                    b) all the members of the team were eager to participate in the project and wanted to contribute as much as possible. 
                    Not once did we have any problems with performance or willingness to work; c) all members of the team are communication-savvy
                    and we managed to avoid any conflicts while working on the project. To say the truth, I did not expect it to be this way, 
                    because this is our first year at university and I thought it would be hard to find a group with adequate, earnest
                    and hard-working people. However, the opposite turned out to be the case for which I am genuinely grateful. 
                    Besides, doing this kind of project provides invaluable experience and an opportunity to practice the concepts 
                    and knowledge taught to us during classes which is a spectacular attribute of education at RMIT.

                <h3> 6.3. Tran Pham Quoc vy </h3>
                <p> When doing the assignment, the good thing about our group was that we were all hard workers and we didnâ€™t hesitate to ask members of our group for help, 
                    our communication was excellent, we were always there and replied to each other about the assignment. However, there was a little problem when we were doing the assignment. 
                    Sometimes, as first-year students of RMIT, we are still quite unclear about the instructions of the assignment which delayed our process, but as a team, we worked hard to get back on track and we 
                    were able to complete the task. Me, Iâ€™m used to being in Monash for 3 total years, so when coming to RMIT as a first-year student, I thought that communication is going to be a problem since lots of 
                    people are shy and afraid to ask questions to strangers, but these guys surprised me with their communication skills. After all, I learned that working as a group requires trust from members, good communication, 
                    and most importantly, every single member needs to work hard on their task so the team can achieve the best result. Overall, Iâ€™m happy that I got into this team.

                <p>
                    Throughout the assignment, my group maintained a high level of communication and collaboration. 
                    We established clear goals and divided tasks efficiently, ensuring that everyone had a defined role and contributed effectively. 
                    Regular meetings helped us stay on track, address challenges promptly, and provide support when needed. The group dynamic was positive, fostering a sense of trust and openness. 
                    One of the surprising things in our group is the level of creativity and innovative thinking of each member. 
                    Everyone brought unique ideas and perspectives, leading to more comprehensive solutions and enhancing the overall quality of our project. Last but not least, 
                    we learned that effective communication and collaboration are paramount for successful group work. Active listening, clear task delegation, 
                    and regular check-ins contribute to a cohesive and productive team. Embracing open-mindedness and respecting diverse viewpoints fosters creativity and innovation.

                <h3> 6.5. Group: </h3>
                <p> In reflection, our group feels proud of the progress we have made during the assignment. 
                    We successfully established strong communication channels and leveraged them to maintain regular contact and resolve challenges collectively. 
                    Each member actively contributed their expertise, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and commitment to project outcomes. One area we identified for improvement is 
                    the need for more frequent updates on individual progress. By implementing a task tracking system, we could enhance transparency and ensure better coordination. 
                    Additionally, we acknowledged the importance of balanced task delegation to prevent potential overload on certain individuals. We were pleasantly surprised by the wealth of 
                    creativity and innovative ideas within our group. Collaborating with diverse perspectives enriched our solutions and sparked new avenues for exploration. This experience highlighted 
                    the value of embracing different viewpoints and leveraging the collective intelligence of the group. Overall, we have learned that effective group dynamics rely on open communication, 
                    active listening, and mutual respect. Through this project, we developed not only technical skills but also important interpersonal skills, reinforcing the significance of collaboration 
                    in achieving successful project outcomes. Moving forward, we aim to apply these lessons in future group projects, leveraging our experiences to continually improve our performance as a team.
