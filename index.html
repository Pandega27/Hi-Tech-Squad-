                <h1>1. TEAM PROFILE !</h1>
                <p>We wanted to create a name that would reflect our team members' goals to begin careers 
                    in the information technology field and take part in exciting initiatives in the future, 
                    so we came up with "Hi-Tech Squad." We could be motivated by the name of this group to develop a cutting-edge program or piece of media 
                    that one day will be useful to all users. 
                </p>
                <h3>1.1 Pandega Bimata Abhinaya </h3>
                <p>My name is Pandega Bimata Abhinaya, most people just call me Abhi or AB. 
                    I'm 19 years old and this is my first year at RMIT University Vietnam. My student ID is S3963166, and my student email is S3963166@rmit.edu.vn. 
                    I am majoring in information technology (IT) and minoring in artificial intelligence at RMIT University. 
                    I received my high school diploma with an IB Diploma from the Australian International School, one of the international institutions in Vietnam. 
                    When I moved to Vietnam in my senior year of high school, information technology ignited me. 
                    It is brought on by my personal interest in how artificial intelligence functions in modern technology like phones, computers, stands, and other devices.
                    Since the digitalization era has begun, the world will mostly be ruled by technology where humans will not be able to live with it. 
                    This does enhance my interest about how AI understands precisely how does the user wants and also I want to research something that is occurring now and 
                    in the future. I don't currently have adequate IT experience as a freshman. 
                    Even though I took IT courses in high school, I still only feel as though I have a rudimentary understanding of the topic. But as time goes on, I'll make an effort
                     to learn something new that could improve my IT knowledge and help me become a better IT professional 
                     in order to make sure that my interest has been appropriately and precisely addressed.

                    This link will take you to the group task we are presently working on. In this group project, 
                    everyone in the group works together to get the best possible grade on the assignment. 
                    The website link that we created from the HTML using Visual Studio code is the one that is displayed above.
                    We divide each part of our group assignment and all of us assemble all of the piece of work in one of the platform called GitHub.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2. Github</h3>

                    Our group has collaborated with the platform called Github, it allows us to work our reports and also HTML file together and collaborate to produce a maximum
                    results for our group project
                </p>
                <h3> 2.3. Commit Changes<h3/>
                <p>Everyone participated in the assignment, and the group made sure to properly commit modifications.
                    We all made changes to the HTML file, and we worked together to decide which changes to make so that the HTML format would be improved over time. 
                    However, overall, our group has done a great job of working together on all of our assignments, including this one. Everyone has successfully contributed to the 
                    project and worked together to ensure that we get the best possible results.

<!-----PROJECT DESC ----->
                <h1>3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
                <h3>3.1. Topic</h3>
                <p> We are now working on a project regarding mindfulness meditation for this topic. 
                    We developed this initiative in order to help those who desire to relax and feel more at ease with their emotions. 
                    The goal of our group's initiative is to educate individuals how to meditate in order to control their emotions while also offering support and advise.
                     This project is primarily intended for teens whose emotions will be unstable owing to their lifestyles, for example, heavy school loads, 
                     intense parental pressure, personal problems, and many other reasons that might alter their attitude and emotions. Not only for teenagers, 
                     also it could help the adult to feel more relaxed and calmer with their emotion too.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     In a discussion, our group shared its opinions regarding the project's components and potential features that may be introduced to help users 
                     get the most out of what they require. As a result, we included a variety of items, such as music, films, meditation techniques, and more. 
                     The outcome expectation for us is fairly high because we positioned the features in a way that fits their needs and wants. We also added some 
                     soothing music and movies. This is one way to support the user's meditation. In order to change the user's emotions and attitude from one of negative to 
                     positive, our objective is to satisfy the consumer with the features we've provided.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2. Motivation</h3>
                <p>Our shared aim for working on this project is to assist people and app users in finding emotional and life balance. 
                    It is a highly vital project to be developed since suicide rates continue to rise yearly and because everyone's mental health is 
                    crucial to their ability to be healthy and productive. Since we're attempting to create this project utilizing coding and AI assistance, 
                    it does belong in the IT disciplines. This project will demonstrate to a potential employer that we are able to write some code to add our additions to the project.
                    In addition, as we gain more experience writing those features, our understanding of coding may advance, which will be extremely helpful in the future. 
                </p>

                <h3>3.3. Landscape</h3>
                 <P>   
                    There are some project that are looks like our project which has been developed first but we are trying to make the better version
                    compare to the other project competitors. As an instance a project called Calm is one of the meditation app that already discovered before. 
                    This software was created with certain features, such as some questions on what type of meditation the users require and instructions on how to meditate. 
                    The fact that we also provide some questions, yet handle users differently, is what distinguishes our app from others. Because we will provide a variety of 
                    techniques using the qualities we possess, and they will be made available to the user for meditation's best outcomes.
